# WebAssembly (Wasm)

This explains **what WebAssembly is**, **why it exists**, and **why people care about it**, without deep technical terms.

---

## 1. Why WebAssembly Exists (Big Picture)

Originally:

* Websites were simple
* Browsers ran only JavaScript
* Heavy apps (Photoshop, games, design tools) could not run well in browsers

Companies wanted:

* Desktop-like apps
* Running inside the browser
* Fast and secure

JavaScript alone was not enough.

That problem led to **WebAssembly**.

---

## 2. What Is WebAssembly?

In simple words:

> **WebAssembly is a way to run fast programs safely, everywhere.**

More clearly:

* It is **not a programming language**
* It is a **binary format** (bytecode)
* Browsers and servers can execute it

Think of Wasm as:

> **A universal program format that many languages can compile into.**

---

## 3. Why Not JavaScript Alone?

JavaScript is:

* Easy to use
* Flexible
* But slower for heavy computation

WebAssembly:

* Runs **near native speed**
* Loads fast
* Uses less memory

So:

* JavaScript → UI and logic
* Wasm → heavy work (graphics, math, ML, games)

They work together.

---

## 4. Wasm vs Old Browser Tech (Flash, Java Applets)

Earlier attempts failed because:

* Security issues
* Vendor control
* Poor performance
* Not standardized

Wasm succeeded because:

* Built by **all major browser vendors**
* Strict security rules
* Open standard (W3C)
* Focuses on **execution**, not language

That’s why Wasm is called:

> **The 4th language of the web**
> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Wasm)

---

## 5. Wasm vs Java (JVM) — Simple Difference

Both:

* Run bytecode
* Hide hardware details

Key difference:

* **JVM** → designed mainly for Java
* **Wasm** → designed for **any language**

Languages that compile to Wasm:

* C / C++
* Rust
* Go
* Python (via tooling)
* Many more

Wasm is **language-agnostic**.

---

## 6. Sandboxing (Most Important Feature)

### What Is Sandboxing?

Sandboxing means:

> **Code runs in a locked box.**

It cannot:

* Access your files
* Access network
* Access memory
* Access OS features

Unless explicitly allowed.

---

### Why This Matters

This makes Wasm:

* Very secure
* Safe for untrusted code

WebAssembly often runs:

* Third-party plugins
* User-uploaded code
* Edge functions

Without sandboxing:

* A bad program could delete files
* Steal secrets
* Crash the system

Security by default
In Wasm:

* No file access by default
* No network access by default
* No system calls by default
* This is safer than native binaries.

Same code, anywhere
Sandboxing ensures:

* Same behavior on all machines
* No OS-specific assumptions
* This makes Wasm portable.

Fast startup + isolation
Sandboxing is:

* Lighter than VMs
* Stronger than containers

So you get:

* Speed
* Safety
  
Browsers and servers can run Wasm without fear.

---

## 7. Why W3C Standard Matters

W3C standard means:

* Long-term support
* Industry trust
* No single company controls it

This is why companies invest in Wasm.

---

## 8. Why Wasm Succeeded in Browsers

Companies wanted:

* Desktop apps in browsers
* No downloads
* No OS dependency

Examples:

* Figma
* Google Earth
* Online games
* Image editors

They achieved:

* Near-native performance
* Smaller downloads
* Cross-platform support

---

## 9. Beyond Browsers: Server-Side Wasm

People realized:

> “These benefits are useful on servers too.”

On servers, Wasm gives:

* Very fast startup
* Strong isolation
* Lower resource usage
* Safe execution of untrusted code

This comes **after**:

* Virtual machines
* Containers

So Wasm is seen as:

> **The next evolution after containers**

---

## 10. Simple Rust Example

Rust code:

* Compiles to `.wasm`
* Runs anywhere with a Wasm runtime

Meaning:

* Same binary
* Works on Linux, Mac, Windows, cloud, edge

No recompilation.

---

## 11. Server-Side Use Cases

Wasm is good for:

* Heavy computation
* ML inference
* Image and video processing
* Game servers
* Edge computing
* IoT

Real users:

* Cloudflare Workers
* Fastly
* Shopify
* Fermyon

---

## 12. WASI (Why It’s Needed)

Problem:

* Wasm is too isolated
* Needs limited access to OS

Solution:

* **WASI (WebAssembly System Interface)**

WASI allows Wasm to:

* Read files (if allowed)
* Read environment variables
* Use system features safely

Still sandboxed, still secure.

---

## 13. Component Model (High Level)

Component model allows:

* Writing reusable Wasm modules
* In any language
* Plugging them together

Think:

> **Language-neutral plugins**

This improves:

* Reuse
* Modularity
* Security

---

## 14. What Is WasmEdge?

> **WasmEdge is like a “Java runtime” but for WebAssembly. It is a runtime that runs WebAssembly on the server.**

It takes a `.wasm` file and **executes it on servers**, not in browsers.

---

## 15. Why WasmEdge Exists

Browsers already know how to run Wasm.
Servers needed the same ability.

WasmEdge provides:

* A fast WebAssembly runtime
* For backend and cloud use cases

---

## 16. What WasmEdge Is Used For

WasmEdge can run Wasm for:

* Backend APIs
* Edge computing
* Serverless functions
* ML inference
* Plugins and extensions

---

## 17. How WasmEdge Is Different from Browsers

| Browser              | WasmEdge                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Runs Wasm in browser | Runs Wasm on server         |
| UI-focused           | Backend-focused             |
| No OS access         | Controlled OS access (WASI) |

---

## 18. How WasmEdge Stays Secure

* Strong sandboxing
* Limited system access
* Only allowed APIs are exposed

So even on servers, Wasm stays safe.

* **Browser** → Chrome runs Wasm
* **Server** → WasmEdge runs Wasm

Same `.wasm` file, different environment.
